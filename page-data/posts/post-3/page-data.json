In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating your first JAMstack application from scratch.\n\n## What is JAMstack?\n\nJAMstack stands for:\n- **J**avaScript: Dynamic functionality\n- **A**PIs: Server-side operations via reusable APIs\n- **M**arkup: Pre-built markup, served from a CDN\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you have:\n- Node.js (v14 or higher) installed\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n- A code editor (we recommend VS Code)\n- Git installed on your machine\n\n## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project\n\nFirst, let's create a new directory for our project and initialize it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-jamstack-app\ncd my-jamstack-app\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n## Step 2: Installing Dependencies\n\nWe'll use several tools to build our JAMstack application:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy axios\n```\n\n## Step 3: Creating Your First Page\n\nCreate a new file called `index.html` in your project root:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>My JAMstack App</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to JAMstack!</h1>\n    <div id=\"api-content\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Step 4: Adding Dynamic Content with APIs\n\nCreate a JavaScript file to fetch data from an API:\n\n```javascript\n// scripts/api.js\nasync function fetchData() {\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    document.getElementById('api-content').innerHTML = data.content;\n}\n\nfetchData();\n```\n\n## Step 5: Building and Deploying\n\nJAMstack sites can be deployed to various platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. The build process pre-renders your pages for optimal performance.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep it Simple**: Start with static content and progressively enhance with JavaScript\n2. **Use CDNs**: Serve your static assets from a CDN for better performance\n3. **Optimize Images**: Use modern image formats and lazy loading\n4. **Security First**: Since there's no server to hack, JAMstack sites are inherently more secure\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You've just built your first JAMstack application. This architecture provides excellent performance, security, and developer experience. As you continue learning, explore more advanced features like serverless functions and headless CMS integration.","date":"2024-01-25","author":"Developer Relations","readTime":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"post-3"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
