    "content": "# Getting Started with Modern Web Development\n\nWelcome to the exciting world of modern web development! In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the latest technologies and best practices that are shaping the future of web applications.\n\n## Why Modern Web Development Matters\n\nThe web has evolved dramatically over the past decade. Today's web applications are faster, more interactive, and provide better user experiences than ever before. By leveraging modern tools and frameworks, developers can create powerful applications that work seamlessly across all devices.\n\n## Key Technologies to Master\n\n### React: The Component Revolution\n\nReact has revolutionized how we think about building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture makes it easy to create reusable, maintainable code that scales with your application.\n\n### Gatsby: Static Site Generation at Its Best\n\nGatsby combines the best of React with powerful build-time optimizations. It pre-renders your pages at build time, resulting in blazing-fast websites that still maintain all the interactivity of modern web apps.\n\n### GraphQL: A Better Way to Handle Data\n\nGraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. With GraphQL, you can request exactly the data you need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.\n\n## Getting Started Today\n\nThe best way to learn is by doing. Start with small projects, experiment with different technologies, and gradually build your skills. The web development community is incredibly supportive, with countless resources available to help you on your journey.\n\nRemember, every expert was once a beginner. The key is to start coding and keep learning!"

    "content": "# Building Your First JAMstack Application\n\nThe JAMstack architecture has become increasingly popular for building fast, secure, and scalable web applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating your first JAMstack application from scratch.\n\n## What is JAMstack?\n\nJAMstack stands for:\n- **J**avaScript: Dynamic functionality\n- **A**PIs: Server-side operations via reusable APIs\n- **M**arkup: Pre-built markup, served from a CDN\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you have:\n- Node.js (v14 or higher) installed\n- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n- A code editor (we recommend VS Code)\n- Git installed on your machine\n\n## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project\n\nFirst, let's create a new directory for our project and initialize it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-jamstack-app\ncd my-jamstack-app\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n## Step 2: Installing Dependencies\n\nWe'll use several tools to build our JAMstack application:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy axios\n```\n\n## Step 3: Creating Your First Page\n\nCreate a new file called `index.html` in your project root:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>My JAMstack App</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to JAMstack!</h1>\n    <div id=\"api-content\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Step 4: Adding Dynamic Content with APIs\n\nCreate a JavaScript file to fetch data from an API:\n\n```javascript\n// scripts/api.js\nasync function fetchData() {\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    document.getElementById('api-content').innerHTML = data.content;\n}\n\nfetchData();\n```\n\n## Step 5: Building and Deploying\n\nJAMstack sites can be deployed to various platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. The build process pre-renders your pages for optimal performance.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep it Simple**: Start with static content and progressively enhance with JavaScript\n2. **Use CDNs**: Serve your static assets from a CDN for better performance\n3. **Optimize Images**: Use modern image formats and lazy loading\n4. **Security First**: Since there's no server to hack, JAMstack sites are inherently more secure\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You've just built your first JAMstack application. This architecture provides excellent performance, security, and developer experience. As you continue learning, explore more advanced features like serverless functions and headless CMS integration."

    "content": "## Introduction\n\nGatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It combines the best of React, GraphQL, and modern JavaScript to create incredibly performant websites.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following installed:\n\n- Node.js (v18.0.0 or newer)\n- npm or yarn package manager\n- Git for version control\n- A code editor (VS Code recommended)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Quick Start\n\nThe fastest way to get started with Gatsby is using the Gatsby CLI:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g gatsby-cli\ngatsby new my-gatsby-site\ncd my-gatsby-site\ngatsby develop\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nIf you prefer to set up your project manually:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-gatsby-site\ncd my-gatsby-site\nnpm init -y\nnpm install gatsby react react-dom\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\nA typical Gatsby project has the following structure:\n\n```\nmy-gatsby-site/\n├── src/\n│   ├── pages/\n│   ├── components/\n│   ├── templates/\n│   └── images/\n├── static/\n├── gatsby-config.js\n├── gatsby-node.js\n├── gatsby-browser.js\n└── gatsby-ssr.js\n```\n\n### Key Directories\n\n- **src/pages**: Contains your site's pages. Each file becomes a route automatically\n- **src/components**: Reusable React components\n- **src/templates**: Page templates for programmatically created pages\n- **static**: Files that are copied directly to the public folder\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Pages and Routing\n\nGatsby automatically creates pages from React components in `src/pages/`:\n\n```javascript\n// src/pages/about.js\nimport React from 'react'\n\nexport default function About() {\n  return <h1>About Page</h1>\n}\n```\n\nThis creates a page at `/about`.\n\n### GraphQL Data Layer\n\nGatsby uses GraphQL to manage data. You can query data in your pages:\n\n```javascript\nimport { graphql } from 'gatsby'\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n```\n\n### Plugins\n\nGatsby's plugin ecosystem is one of its greatest strengths. Common plugins include:\n\n- `gatsby-plugin-image`: Optimized image loading\n- `gatsby-source-filesystem`: Source data from your filesystem\n- `gatsby-transformer-remark`: Transform markdown files\n\n## Building Your First Page\n\nLet's create a simple blog post page:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { graphql } from 'gatsby'\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\n\nexport default function BlogPost({ data }) {\n  const post = data.markdownRemark\n  \n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <h1>{post.frontmatter.title}</h1>\n      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.html }} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query($slug: String!) {\n    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\n      html\n      frontmatter {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nGatsby includes many performance optimizations out of the box:\n\n- **Code Splitting**: Automatically splits your code into smaller bundles\n- **Prefetching**: Prefetches resources for faster navigation\n- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loads and optimizes images\n- **Static Generation**: Pre-builds pages at compile time\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. Use `gatsby-plugin-image` for all images\n2. Implement proper SEO with `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`\n3. Add a manifest file for PWA support\n4. Use environment variables for sensitive data\n\n## Deployment\n\nGatsby sites can be deployed to many platforms:\n\n### Netlify\n\n```bash\ngatsby build\nnetlify deploy --dir=public\n```\n\n### GitHub Pages\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev gh-pages\n```\n\nAdd to `package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"deploy\": \"gatsby build && gh-pages -d public\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n**Build fails with \"window is not defined\"**\n- Wrap browser-specific code in a check:\n```javascript\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n  // Browser code here\n}\n```\n\n**GraphQL query errors**\n- Use GraphiQL at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` to test queries\n\n**Slow build times**\n- Enable incremental builds\n- Use `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache` for CI/CD\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand the basics, explore:\n\n- [Advanced GraphQL queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql/)\n- [Creating custom plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-plugins/)\n- [Gatsby Theme development](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/)\n- [Server-side rendering options](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr/)\n\nHappy building with Gatsby! 🚀"
